# Technical Challenge: Taco Assembly
### `Beacon Design x Seroclinix | Development`

First off, thank you so much for applying to Seroclinix! We're excited to meet you and chat with you about what we want to accomplish and how you can help.

Before we get there, we'd love if you could complete this technical challenge to determine if you're the right fit for this particular role.

## Why?
- helps us understand if you can learn new technology quickly. In a startup world, it's vital that developers are elastic and not bound to particular tools. In this case, if you haven't encountered React already, you'll have to get familiar with it. (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
- helps us understand if you have experience with core web development technologies such as HTML and CSS.
- helps us understand if you can think logically and reason solutions to problems.
- helps us understand if you know more about the ecosystem: preprocessors such as SASS, javascript libraries, node & npm etc.
- helps us understand if you can get familiar with an existing architecture quickly and if you have the ability to traverse, deduce and reverse-engineer code.
